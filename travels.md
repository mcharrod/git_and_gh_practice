It was such a privilege to live in Hawai'i for 2 years. I loved the weather, the people, the beach. My favorite activity when I was there was hiking up to a water hole.

I also spent 8 hours in Seattle and went around the Pike Place Marketplace. I don't much like Starbucks, but it was super cool to visit America's first Starbucks shop!
