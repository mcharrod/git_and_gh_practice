I am motivated to change my career because I would like to make my sister proud. She has supported me to get this far and I don't want to let her down.

I feel that this is a positive change in my career path. I will be doing work that is closer to what I want to be doing and has the ability to create meaningful change in this world. 

Plus, people think that computer programmers are wizards.
